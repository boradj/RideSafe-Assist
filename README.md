# RideSafe-Assist - Thesis


This repository presents the details of my thesis, titled *"Development and Implementation of a real-time alert system for cyclists using deep learning and computer vision"* It focuses on improving cyclist safety through a combination of object detection (YOLOFastestV2) and ultrasonic sensors.

---

## *Thesis Summary*

The system is designed to:
- Detect vehicles approaching a cyclist from the rear and sides.
- Measure accurate distances using the camera.
- Provide real-time alerts of proximity and other vehicle to enhance cyclist safety.

### *Highlights*
- *Object Detection Model*: YOLOFastestV2.
- *Hardware Integration*: Raspberry Pi 4B, ultrasonic sensors, and camera module.
- *Key Features*: Multi-vehicle detection, real-time feedback, and high responsiveness.
